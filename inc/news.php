                    <h2><strong>October 14<sup>th</sup></strong>
					</h2>
					<p>The RYA Cymru Club Youth Racing Circuit (CYRC) was run at Tata on October 14<sup>th</sup> for  single day event. The forecast was spot on with a westerly F4 making way for a Southerly F2 after the first race.
					</p>
					<p>It meant that the race course had to be moved completely, including the commitee boat to keep the set courses as per the instructions and brief. All six races were completed wth a lunch break half way through
					</p>
