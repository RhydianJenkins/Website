                    <h2>Pembroke</h2>
					<p>The travelling fleet were feeling the strain of the pace of the series at Pembroke with only two boats making the trip. It was great to see fellow travellers Paul and John and Ken and Chris in their Ospreys, with Ken making the 5 hour trip from Kent to enjoy the fabulous weather in Milford Haven
					</p>
					<p>Saturday, 1st July, and a clever delay on the start, undoubtedly influenced by the Lions victory in New Zealand, allowed the breeze to pick up to a comfortable F3 North Westerly, bring a slight chop and healthy blow to help the Ospreys and hinder the fireball.
					</p>
					<p>True to form, Gordon and Ruth took the first race on a tight trapezoid course with a full beat up against a turning neap tide. The second race saw Gordon getting frustrated on the start line and forced to retire with equipment failure. The wind built slightly for the third race and the tide turning to push the Osprey to the front end of the fleet. The course was \changed to a triangle sausage to allow for variation and to challenge the different boat attributes and spread the opportunities
					</p>
					<p>Day 2 saw a lighter wind for the 12 mile 7 Forts race and a running start helped the Osprey to get out near the front of the fleet early and allow them some clean air. The Fireball was playing catch-up on the 5 mile beat against the tide, always a difficult ask.
					</p>
					<p>There was some stunning scenery to be enjoyed for those with the time to do it throughout the delightfull harbour â€“ just needed to avoid the commercial traffic and numerous sailboats brought out by the fine weather. It was dreamy Osprey conditions that lead them to a clean sweep 1-2-3 for the day.
					</p>
					<p>The event was noted for its great race management, fabulous weather, friendly hospitality and top class facilities
