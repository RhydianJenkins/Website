        <h1 class="page-header">OOD Rota For 2017 <small>01/01/2017</small></h1>
        <p>An on-line portal has been set up to allow members to select and manage their own Officer of the Day duties.
        </p>
        <p>The portal can be found at<br> <a href= "https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=76809:1" target="_blank">Member's OOD Portal</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Please select 3 dates each that suit you. OOD rota has closed and members names missing will be entered by the scheduler.</p>
        <p>Without knowing your choice, your duties will be allocated and you will need to arrange your own substitues once the rota is finalised. Please make every effort to select dates that suit you.</p>
