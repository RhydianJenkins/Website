            <p>Whatever your ability, the Lake is ideal for windsurfing in most wind directions, with a spacious grassy area for rigging, and an easy launching area.
            You don’t have to worry about tides and you can enjoy the luxury of hot showers, hot drinks and the chance to have a chat with other members.</p>
            <p>The lake is open for windsurfing on Sundays only from October to mid March;  in the Spring and Summer we’re also open on Saturdays and Tuesday and Wednesday evenings (see club booklet).</p>
